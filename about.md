**Karl Sheng** is a Master's student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University in Houston, TX. He completed his bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ. Through various project and research experiences, he discovered his passion for robotics, computer vision, and embedded systems.

Inspired by his high school classmate Joseph and undergraduate professor Dr. Kevin Lu, Karl decided not to waste his time during the summer and create his own website. Despite being uncertain about his future lifestyle and career path at the moment, he wants to take a step further by utilizing this personal blog to record his study notes, random thoughts, and memorable moments in his life. While he is unsure of how this blog will ultimately impact himself or those around him, he followed his instinct, went ahead, and did it.

In the past 20+ years of life outside the school, Karl enjoys traveling and engaging in outdoor activities, such as hiking, camping, and kayaking. He also has a passion for cooking. One of his immature ideas on his bucket list is to open a restaurant, even though he finds the idea of preparing his own dinner every day to be rather boring. Recently, with some free time during the summer, he wants to learn something new in robotics, either to prepare for job opportunities, PhD applications in related fields, or simply to satisfy his own interests. And so, let the blog get started from here.
